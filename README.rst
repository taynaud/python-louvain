Louvain Community Detection
===========================

Installing
----------

To build and install run from source::

     python setup.py install

You can also install from pip with::

    pip install python-louvain


The package name on pip is `python-louvain` but it is imported as `community`
in python. You will find documentation about this module at
http://python-louvain.readthedocs.io/


Usage
-----

To use as a python library::


    from community import community_louvain
    import networkx as nx
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Replace this with your networkx graph loading depending on your format !
    G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(30, 0.05)

    #first compute the best partition
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

    #drawing
    size = float(len(set(partition.values())))
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
    count = 0.
    for com in set(partition.values()) :
        count = count + 1.
        list_nodes = [nodes for nodes in partition.keys()
                                    if partition[nodes] == com]
        nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, list_nodes, node_size = 20,
                                    node_color = str(count / size))


    nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, alpha=0.5)
    plt.show()



There is also a command line::

     $ community <filename>

filename is a binary file as generated by the
convert utility distributed with the C implementation at https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/ This is mostly for debugging purpose
and I advise to use this module more as a library with your graph loading code
than with this command.
