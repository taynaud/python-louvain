Community detection for NetworkX's documentation
=================================================
This module implements community detection.


It uses the louvain method described in
Fast unfolding of communities in large networks,
Vincent D Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, Renaud Lefebvre,
Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment 2008(10), P10008 (12pp)

It depends on Networkx to handle graph operations :
http://networkx.lanl.gov/

The program can be found in a repository where you can also report bugs :

Example :
=========

As a command line utility :
-------------------------
You should consider using the cpp version at
http://findcommunities.googlepages.com/ !

./community.py file.bin > tree



where file.bin is a binary graph as generated by the convert utility of the cpp
version.

The generated file can then be used with the hierarchy utility of the cpp version.
Note that the program does not make many verifications about the arguments,
and is expecting a friendly use.

As python module :
------------------

::

    import community as community_louvain
    import matplotlib.cm as cm
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import networkx as nx

    # load the karate club graph
    G = nx.karate_club_graph()

    #first compute the best partition
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

    # compute the best partition
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

    # draw the graph
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
    # color the nodes according to their partition
    cmap = cm.get_cmap('viridis', max(partition.values()) + 1)
    nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, partition.keys(), node_size=40,
                           cmap=cmap, node_color=list(partition.values()))
    nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, alpha=0.5)
    plt.show()
